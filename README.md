# Algorithmic-Pattern-Recognition 
This is due to fulfillment my internship and reseach work in order to develope a possible pattern dictionary using autoencoders for Stock market. I used Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Convulational Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent neural networks (RNN) to develop my autoencoders engine.
